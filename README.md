# The React Admin Dashboard

ğŸ“Š The React Admin Dashboard project was created to demonstrate my proficiency with React and its libraries. It also shows how much I know about working with charts, forms, Light & Dark Mode and tables.
In this project I use libraries:
ğŸ”¹Material UI - for creating UI components
ğŸ”¹React-router-dom - for routing
ğŸ”¹React-pro-sidebar - for creating sidebar
ğŸ”¹Formik - for form management
ğŸ”¹Yup - for form validation
ğŸ”¹Fullcalendar - for interactive calendar integration
ğŸ”¹Nivo - for creating and visualizing interactive charts
